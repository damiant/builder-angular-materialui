# Design System Component Reference

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the design system's component architecture and available components for code generation and development reference.

## System Architecture

The design system follows a modular component-based architecture where each component group provides specific functionality. Components are organized into logical groups that can work independently or in combination with other components.

### Component Organization Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component group serves a specific purpose
- **Composability**: Components can be combined to create complex interfaces
- **Consistency**: All components follow the same design patterns and API conventions
- **Accessibility**: Components are built with accessibility standards in mind

## Documentation Structure

For detailed documentation on any component group, refer to the corresponding MDX file in the `design-system-docs` folder. The documentation files follow the naming convention:

```
design-system-docs/[componentgroupname].mdx
```

For example:

- `design-system-docs/button.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Button component
- `design-system-docs/table.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Table component
- `design-system-docs/formfield.mdx` - Detailed documentation for the FormField group
- `design-system-docs/stepper.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Stepper component

These MDX files contain comprehensive information including:

- Component API documentation
- Usage examples
- Props and configuration options
- Best practices and implementation guidelines
- Accessibility requirements
- Integration patterns with other components

## Component Dependencies

### Hierarchical Component Groups

Some component groups require multiple components to work together in a specific hierarchical structure:

- **Table Group**: Requires proper hierarchy of MatTable, MatHeaderCell, MatFooterCell, MatCell, MatHeaderRow, MatFooterRow, MatRow, and various definition components
- **Stepper Group**: Requires MatStepper as container with MatStep components and related step navigation elements
- **Tabs Group**: Requires MatTabGroup as container with MatTab components and related tab elements
- **TabNavigation Group**: Requires MatTabNav with MatTabLink components
- **Expansion Group**: Requires MatAccordion as container with MatExpansionPanel components and related content elements
- **FormField Group**: Requires MatFormField as wrapper with MatLabel, MatError, MatHint, and optional MatPrefix/MatSuffix components
- **SelectionList Group**: Requires MatSelectionList with MatListOption components
- **ListItem Group**: Supports optional sub-components like MatListItemTitle, MatListItemLine, etc.
- **Select Group**: Requires MatSelect with MatOption components, optionally grouped with MatOptgroup
- **Radio Group**: Requires MatRadioGroup as container with MatRadioButton components

- **Datepicker Group**: Requires MatDatepicker with MatDatepickerInput and MatDatepickerToggle

### Context Sharing Components

- **FormField**: Provides required context sharing for form controls

### Interdependent Components

- **SelectionList**: Components have required interdependency between list and options

## Usage Guidelines

### Component Dependencies

- Most single components (Button, Card, Checkbox, etc.) are self-contained and can be used independently
- Hierarchical component groups require specific parent-child relationships
- Form controls should be wrapped in FormField components for proper labeling and validation display
- Navigation components can be used independently or as part of larger layout structures

### Integration Patterns

- Layout components (Toolbar, Sidenav, Drawer) typically serve as containers for other components
- Form controls work best when combined with FormField for proper labeling and error handling
- Data display components (Table, List) can be enhanced with interactive elements like buttons and pagination
- Navigation components (Tabs, Stepper, Menu) provide structure for organizing content and workflows

### Accessibility Considerations

- All components are built with accessibility in mind using Angular Material's accessibility features
- Use semantic HTML structures provided by the components
- Leverage built-in ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Form components include proper labeling and error announcement capabilities

### Responsive Design

- Layout components provide responsive behavior out of the box
- Grid and list components adapt to different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly navigation patterns are built into navigation components
- Material Design principles ensure consistent responsive behavior

## Angular Material Integration

This design system is built on Angular Material UI components, providing:

- **Consistent theming** across all components
- **Built-in accessibility** features and ARIA support
- **Material Design** compliance and visual consistency
- **TypeScript support** with full type definitions
- **Reactive forms** integration for form controls
- **CDK integration** for advanced component behaviors

## Usage Reference

This reference should be used to understand the available components and their intended purposes when generating code or building applications with this design system. For specific implementation details, always consult the corresponding MDX documentation file in the `design-system-docs` folder.
